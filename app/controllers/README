In controllers, we have to check request method at each action for sercurity.
It is because in routes.rb of Redmine, there is a default route:
map.connect ':controller/:action/:id'

This map is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) hole because it lets hackers
access virtually all actions in our controllers through GET method. See:
